Changes in v2:
- only run over actual git source files.
- omit any files in t/
- print cppcheck version to allow for better comparison between
  different build environments
- introduce CPPCHECK_FLAGS which can be overridden in the make command
  line. This also uses a GNU make-ism to allow CPPCHECK_ADD to specify
  additional checks to be enabled.
