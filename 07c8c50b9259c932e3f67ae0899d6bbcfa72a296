At $dayjob we have a patch base work-flow where committers sign patches
on the way through. Occasionally when a larger patch series is involved
it's easier pull from the submitter's repo and use git rebase to add the
required sign off.

This is my attempt at making this a little less cumbersome by adding a
'sign' command. I decided not to add a short version of the command,
partly because 's' was taken and partly because it is a bit of a niche
use-case.
